I finished the final build for this Ludum Dare! YAY !

There are still some things missing that would have been nice to have, but it's enough for me. Maybe there will be updates in the future. We'll see.

The new version can be found [here](http://ld31.lhoe.de/) again.

## Changes since the last build
It is now possible to hire and fire crew members, there's music and (one) sound and all the crew members have a class now, which gives them improvement in different situations. And finally I've made some improvements to the UI and many other small things.

### Classes
* Cook: reduces the food consumption of the crew members by 10%
* Engineer: reduces the energy consumption while traveling between planets by 10%
* Trader: increases the selling price by 10% and decrease the buying price by 10% for all goods

More than one crew member of a class on the ship doesn't add extra percents.
