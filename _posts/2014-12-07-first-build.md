I created a first build of "Captain's Retirement" for everyone to test, Hurray!
you can find it [here](http://ld31.lhoe.de/)

The build includes interplanetary traveling and a trading system, so you can start to make money for your life after your captain career.

Feel free to give feedback! You can find my contact data on my [website](http://lhoe.de).

Have fun exploring the solar system ;)



## Bugs, missing features and other nasty stuff
* you have to reload the page if you want to start again
* mouseOut events aren't triggered when the button gets hidden, so there might be tooltips visible when they shouldn't and some other visual bugs
* Crew is still pretty useless

Now that I have a first version to hand in, I will start adding some extra features, like:

* Classes for the Crew (An _Engineer_ reduces the energy consumption, a _Trader_ gets better prices for goods, a _Cook_ reduces the food consumption, etc)
* Jobs to earn money on the different planets (Not sure how this should look like)
* Hire and Fire your Crew
