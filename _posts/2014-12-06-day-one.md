I made it through the first day of the Jam, yeah! This is what I've got so far:
![Day One result]({{site.baseurl}}/images/day1.png)

I have a generated solar system, a _living_ crew, meaning they need food and water to live, the crew is getting paid and all of them are aging. I can accelerate the time (really useful for interplanetary travelling) and thanks to the map, I know where I am in the system.

I've also created the basics, like a sliced sprite, for tooltips and more or less dynamic buttons on the bottom.

## Plans for tomorrow
1. travelling between planets (almost everything is prepared for this)
2. contracts (to earn some money from the colonists)
3. trading (to earn even more money and be sure that the crew won't starve)
4. crew skills (every ship needs its specialists)
5. crew management (hire and fire)

And some UI improvements at the very end ;)
