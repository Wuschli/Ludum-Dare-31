I created a rough layout for the one screen available. Including a ship deck plan, a crew list on the right, and some space for additional information and interaction on the bottom.

![screen layout]({{site.basedir}}/images/screen_layout.png)

The bottom menu will be used for the star map on the right, status information, like current money, captain's age and ship status, in the middle and maybe some kind of communicator menu on the left. I am not sure how to use the space on the bottom left, but some kind of button menu should be useful.

The ship contains a big cargo room in the middle, some crew quarters on the top and bottom, an engine room on the right, bathrooms next to the engine room, a community room to left of the cargo room, officer's and captain's quarter behind the cockpit and the cockpit on the very left.
The cargo room is bigger than it looks like on the plan, because it's at the bottom of the ship, underneath the other rooms.
